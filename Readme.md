#Foster

Finds potentially orphaned files in your project.

## Dependencies
go get github.com/cheggaaa/pb

## TODO
- Unit Tests
- Better output
    - Use https://github.com/andrew-d/go-termutil to hide meta output for cleaner piping 
- More robust guessing for determining if a file is used or not
    - Handle relative file paths? 


##Warning
This may be useful, but it's a learning project. 
I may or may (probably) not have done things right.
